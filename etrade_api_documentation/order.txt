Notes
For complex options, only the first leg of the option shows the actual order status. Subsequent legs show the status as OPEN.

For equity and option orders, types STOP and STOP LIMIT represent the "Stop On Quote" and "Stop Limit on Quote" price types offered by E*TRADE, respectively.

For equity orders, use limit price for type LIMIT, stop price for type STOP, and both prices for type STOP_LIMIT. For option orders, use limit price for type LIMIT, stop price for type STOP, and stop-limit price for type STOP_LIMIT.

To page through a large number of items, use the count property to specify how many items to return in a group (the default is 25), and the marker property to specify the starting point (the default is the newest). For instance, a request with no count and no marker retrieves the newest 25 items for the account. Each response includes a marker that points to the beginning of the next group. To page through all the items, repeat the request with the marker from each previous response until you receive a response with an empty marker, indicating that there are no more items.

The API does not explicitly provide for bidirectional paging. Your application can support paging backward and forward either by saving and reusing markers within the series (that is, to reissue the requests for earlier pages in the series), or saving and redisplaying the items that come in.
